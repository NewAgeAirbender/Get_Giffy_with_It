# Get_Giffy_with_It

Loads buttons with the names of a few circus acts on them. Users can add buttons as they like. When a button is clicked, a call is made to the Giphy API and the first 10 gifs are displayed with the rating.

When the gifs are displayed, they are still. Once the user clicks on one (it might take a while to load) the gifs start playing.
